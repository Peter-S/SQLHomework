	SELECT [PersonLastName], [PersonFirstName],[PersonEntryDate] FROM Person
	INNER JOIN PersonAddress 
	ON Person.PersonKey = PersonAddress.PersonKey
	UNION 
	SELECT [EmployeeLastName],[EmployeeFirstName],[EmployeeHireDate] FROM
	MetroAlt.dbo.Employee

	-- General Maintenance. You can use employees 60 and 69 they are both mechanics.

	use MetroAlt;

		INSERT INTO BusService(BusServiceName)
		Values('General Maintenance'), ('Brake Service'), ('Hydraulic Maintenance'), ('Mechanical Repair')
		
		INSERT INTO Maintenance(MaintenanceDate, BusKey)
		VALUES(GETDATE(), 12)
		INSERT INTO [dbo].[MaintenanceDetail](Maintenancekey,EmployeeKey,BusServiceKey)
		values(IDENT_CURRENT('Maintenance'), 60, 1), (IDENT_CURRENT('Maintenance'), 60, 2)


--5. Create a table that has the same structure as Employee, name it Drivers.

	CREATE TABLE Drivers (
		DriverKey int identity (1,1),
		DriverLastName  nvarchar(255) not null,
		DriverFirstName nvarchar(255) not null,
